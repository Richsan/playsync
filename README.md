## Channels
Channel is a place where you can put and take values.

Operations:
```clojure
(>!! c "put value inside channel")

(<!! c) ; taking value from channel
```

A channel with buffer size of n just can acceppt at most n puts without blocking.

To unblock a put operation you should take the value from channel.

The put! and take! functions has its own buffer separated from channel's buffer.

### Buffer Anatomy
put!,take! and channel queues

## Go Blocks
* go blockâ€”runs concurrently on a separate thread.
* Go blocks run your processes on a thread pool that contains a number of threads equal to 2 + the number of cores on your machine

Go blocks executes in an event loop
